# 🌙 TarotTales – A Guided Tarot Reflection Journal

TarotTales is a mindful journaling tool designed specifically for tarot readers who want to deepen their understanding of the cards, build intuitive connections, and reflect on their daily experiences. While the market is full of tarot decks and general journaling products, TarotTales uniquely blends the two. It offers a space to capture the _story behind the card_.

## 📌 Project Status

**Current Status: In Development (Week 5)**

We've completed the following milestones:

- ✅ Designed the mystical UI with cosmic theme
- ✅ Built the landing page with radiant input field
- ✅ Created responsive header component with logo
- ✅ Set up modern React environment with Vite
- ✅ Implemented AI-powered tarot reading/chat (with Aura the cat spirit)
- ✅ Modular API integration and CORS setup
- ✅ Card reveal animation in chat using TarotCard component
- ✅ **Web chat trial now limited to 2 follow-up questions; after that, an ad for the upcoming app is shown and further chatting is disabled**

## ✨ Features

- **AI Tarot Chat:** Ask a question, get a mystical reading, and chat with Aura the cat spirit for follow-up insights.
- **Card Reveal Animation:** Each card is revealed one by one with a flip animation and text fade-in, using the TarotCard component for consistency.
- **Free Web Trial Limit:** Users can ask up to 2 follow-up questions in the web chat. After the limit, an ad for the upcoming TarotTales app is shown (with image and call to action), and further chatting is disabled.
- **App Promotion:** The ad block encourages users to follow for updates and try the full-featured app when released.
- **Modern, Modular Codebase:** Built with React, Vite, modular API utilities, and a scalable backend.

## 📝 Changelog

- **5/16/2024**: Added web chat trial limit and app ad feature. Improved card reveal animation and switched to using the TarotCard component in chat.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Vite, React Router
- **UI**: Custom CSS with radiant borders, cosmic theme
- **Fonts**: Ojuju and Cormorant
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB for user data and journal entries
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for tarot interpretations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB account (for database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xanx66/Tarot_Diary.git
cd Tarot_Diary
```

2. Install backend dependencies

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

3. Install frontend dependencies

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

4. Set up environment variables

   - **Backend**: Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add:
     - Your MongoDB connection string as `MONGODB_URI` (not needed for current progress)
     - Your JWT secret as `JWT_SECRET` (not needed for current progress)
     - Your OpenAI API key as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - If `USE_OPENAI` is set to `false` or omitted, the backend will use mock data for development/testing and will not call the real OpenAI API.
   - **Frontend**: For local development, you do **not** need to set `VITE_API_URL` in `.env` (leave it unset or blank). The Vite dev server will proxy API requests to the backend automatically.
   - For **production**, set `VITE_API_URL` in the frontend `.env.production` to your deployed backend URL (e.g., `VITE_API_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com`).

5. Run the development servers

```bash
# Start the backend (from server directory)
npm run dev

# Start the frontend (from client directory)
npm run dev
```

### CORS & API Communication

- The backend uses CORS middleware with a function to allow requests from `http://localhost:5173` and `http://localhost:3000` during development.
- The frontend uses axios with `withCredentials: true` and an interceptor to automatically attach the Bearer token if the user is logged in.
- **Do not** set any `Access-Control-Allow-*` headers in the frontend; these are handled by the backend.
- All API calls use relative URLs (e.g., `/api/ai/initial-reading`) in development, and the Vite proxy forwards them to the backend.

### Troubleshooting

- If you see CORS errors or 403 Forbidden errors:
  - Make sure your backend is running and accessible at the correct port (default: 5000 or 8000).
  - Ensure your frontend is running at `http://localhost:5173`.
  - Double-check that your backend CORS config uses a function for the `origin` option and includes your frontend's URL.
  - Do **not** set `VITE_API_URL` in `.env` for local development; let the Vite proxy handle API requests.
  - Restart both frontend and backend after changing any config.
